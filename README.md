# 💻 CloudTunes 🎵

_**Music Playback, the way you want it.**_ 

## Introduction 

Dropping music files in your free Google Drive storage and being able to
access it anywhere with unlimited cross-device access. Magical, isn’t it?

## Description 

There is no music streaming service that can play
multimedia files from commonly used cloud services
We hardly find any app that allows dropping music files in
your free Google Drive storage and being able to access it
anywhere with unlimited cross-device access.

Cloud storage services have not been used by major music
streaming company . It is more secure and convenient
compared to other forms of storage.

## Features 

After downloading the application, the users get access to the following key features:

### 1) Secure Login through Google Cloud Platform
The application is developed, giving utmost priority to user security and data privacy.
Thus, the login system implemented is OAuth, which is one of the finest and most
user-friendly methods for securely accessing user data. OAuth gives the users
complete information about the data they are providing to the application, even having
an option to invoke the access whenever they want.
### 2) Unlimited Access to Music on Google Drive Platform
Google Drive is universally accessible by anyone having a Google Account, which in turn
comes with Google Drive storage. The software application will provide users to directly
access their cloud storage, and the music files stored in it.
### 3) Uninterrupted Music Playback
With the advent of music streaming services, come persistent ads and interruptions. To
make sure users are free from all these distractions and annoyances, our CBMS
requires no paid subscription and ships with zero ads.
### 4) Recommendation System
The recommendation system is a sub-component of our CBMS. It provides users songs
which they may like, based on the songs that they previously listened to. Every
logged-in user should have access to the recommender system. The system will go
through the songs that the user previously listened to, then according to that
information, it should provide songs to the user. An API for the same will be
constructed to make HTTP requests to access large databases of music records to
provide these recommendations.
### 5) Efficient Usage of Device Storage
High-quality audio files take up a lot of storage on our mobile devices. In many cases, it
leads to a shortage of storage space. Our CBMS fetches all of your music libraries from
Google Drive which minimizes usage of storage. We only take up a small portion of the
device’s storage to cache the metadata of files for faster app performance.
